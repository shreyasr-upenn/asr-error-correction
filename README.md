### Abstract
We present a comparative study for solving the problem of ASR
error correction. We treat ASR error correction as a post processing
task. We have experimented with grammar correction models and
GPT-3 to solve this task. We have observed that grammar correction
models can help correct contextual errors and if fine-tuned on large
volume of data can potentially be very useful for solving the problem of
ASR error correction.
